Git-Hub Orientation Repository with ideas

Hi, my name is Zach and I am new to Github. I have taught myself the basics of several programming languages, but I would like to eventually become a developer, so I am on Github to start that journey.

The purpose of this repository is to store random code and to be an idea bank.
